Description: Estimates semi-parametric high-dimensional state-space models.
    Here we presume that both the observation and state distributions have Gaussian
    noise, but we let the observation equation evolve as an additive model in the
    state. In particular, we expand the state in the spline basis and estimate
    the coefficients via the group lasso. As this model is non-linear, we use the
    Laplace-Gaussian filter to estimate the hidden states quickly and accurately.
